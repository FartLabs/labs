üß™ Labs by [**@FartLabs**](https://github.com/FartLabs)

## Overview

A Lab is a data structure designed for composable and type-safe management of
variables and procedures.

## Usage

```ts
import { Lab } from "./labs.ts";
import { notesLab } from "./notes.ts";
import { linksLab } from "./links.ts";

const myLab = new Lab()
  .extend(notesLab)
  .extend(linksLab);

const note1 = myLab.execute("notes.add", {
  content: "Hello, World!",
});
const note2 = myLab.execute("notes.add", {
  content: "Goodbye, World!",
});

myLab.execute("links.link", {
  ids: [note1.id, note2.id],
});
```

## Examples

- ["Your First Lab"](https://github.com/FartLabs/labs/discussions/2) is an
  example that demonstrates the basic concepts of Labs.
- [example.ts](./example.ts) contains a more advanced example showcasing the
  convenience of composing Labs.

## Concepts

- **Lab**: A container that holds a collection of named variables and functions
  (procedures).
- **Variable**: A named storage location within a Lab that holds a value.
- **Procedure**: A function defined within a Lab that performs a specific task
  and has type-safe access to variables and procedures within the same Lab.

## Benefits

Labs excel in promoting modularity and reusability. Small, well-defined Labs can
be composed to create complex data structures. This approach simplifies code
composition and improves code quality by reducing _redundancy_ and enhancing
_readability_. Additionally, this approach avoids the need for intricate
inheritance hierarchies with keywords like `super`, `this`, and `extends`.

## Use cases

> [!NOTE]
>
> Example Labs demonstrating the following use cases will be added in the
> future.

- **State management**: Labs can be used to manage application state by
  encapsulating state variables and state-changing procedures within a Lab.
- **Data processing**: Labs can be used to encapsulate data processing logic,
  making it easier to manage and reuse.
- **API clients**: Labs can be used to encapsulate API clients, making it easier
  to manage API calls and responses.
- **Configuration management**: Labs can be used to manage application
  configuration by encapsulating configuration variables and procedures within a
  Lab.
- **Second brain**: Labs can be used to encapsulate knowledge and procedures
  that are useful for a specific domain or task.
- **Testing**: Labs can be used to encapsulate test data and test procedures,
  making it easier to manage and reuse test cases.
- **Miscellaneous**: Labs can be used for any task that requires encapsulation,
  modularity, and reusability.
